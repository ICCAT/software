\section{Introduction}

Stock assessments underpin the scientific management advice provided by the Standing Committee on Research 
and Statistics (SCRS) to the Commission. The SCRS has therefore implemented a number of activities to help improve 
the quality of this advice. 

One such activity is the development of a catalog of stock assessment software. The purpose of the 
catalog is not to evaluate the relative merits of various assessment methods, but rather whether the 
software implementing the method works as intended and is adequately documented.  
Inclusion of a particular computer program in the ICCAT software catalogue does not guarantee that the software is 
free of bugs, nor does it imply any sort of institutional endorsement for its use. Inclusion in the catalog is simply 
a way of documenting what steps, if any, the programmer has taken to ensure that the program does what it purports to do. 


Following the establishment of the catalogue the Strategic Initiative on Stock Assessment Methods (SISAM) has been started by ICES 
to advance knowledge on the use and development of  stock assessments and guide scientists to the most appropriate stock assessment 
software/methods. The development of a repository of stock assessment methods is also under discussion by SISAM.

The Working Group on Stock Assessment Methods (WGSAM) of ICCAT recommended to work with SISAM to ensure that 
the ICCAT software catalogue becomes part of a worldwide repository of stock assessment methods. 
In order to review the procedures related to the ICCAT software catalogue it has been decided to evaluate 
whether i) software in non-ICCAT repositories already fulfills the existing criteria for inclusion in the ICCAT software catalogue 
and ii) are there important criteria missing from the ICCAT catalogue requirements that should be included. Following this
review the intention is to propose how the ICCAT software catalogue could become part of a global repository of stock assessment software

The proposal is to do this through a test case, based on evaluating whether the SS3 software available from the NOAA toolbox  
(\url{http://nft.nefsc.noaa.gov/SS3.html}) currently fullfills requirements of the ICCAT software catalogue 
( \url{http://www.iccat.int/en/AssessCatalog.htm}).

\section{Current Requirements}

The current requirements for inclusion in the ICCAT software catalogue are listed below. Could you i) summarise
in your opinion what the actual criteria for fullfilling these requirements should be and ii) summarise whether
these are currently met for SS3.

\subsection{Distribution limitations}
\subsection{Compiler needs, stand-alone}
\subsection{Purpose}
\subsection{Description}
\subsection{Required inputs}
\subsection{Program outputs}
\subsection{Diagnostics}
\subsection{Other features}
\subsection{History of method peer review}
\subsection{Steps taken by programmer for validation}
\subsection{Tests conducted by others}

\section{Potential Future Requirements}

In your opinion could you suggest additional requirements and the conditions for fullfilling them (feel free to
add) e.g.

\subsection{Licencing}
\subsection{Simulation testing}
