Version Control</A>
</H2>

<P>
Version controlis a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later, e.g. track changes in MS Word. A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. 

<P>
A simple version-control method is to copy files into another directory (time-stamped if you are wise). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to. To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with others. Therefore, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems, such as CVS<A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot83"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A>, Subversion<A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot84"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN></SUP></A>, and Perforce<A NAME="tex2html15"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot85"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN></SUP></A>, have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this was the standard for version control. This offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on a project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what; and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.

<P>
However, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything – the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines. Local VCS systems suffer from this same problem – whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.

<P>
Therefore Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) was developed. In a DVCS (such as Git<A NAME="tex2html17"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot86"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN></SUP></A>, Mercurial<A NAME="tex2html19"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot87"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">11</SPAN></SUP></A>, Bazaar<A NAME="tex2html21"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot88"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN></SUP></A> or Darcs<A NAME="tex2html23"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot89"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">13</SPAN></SUP></A>), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository. Thus if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.

<P>
Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project.
