Dear Sir,

As chair of subcommittee of ecosystem, and I send you Japanese proposal basically coming from Japanese shark & billfish assessment team for your request;

 

We like to propose for the preparation of Use-friendly Bayesian Surplus Production model program. Current situation of this program is;

1)) Different modeling scientist using different program, namely, each modelist using his/her own program.

2)  One of most famous program is the one developed by Prof. McAllister is written by rather old language. And very nice program with high reliability but hard to understand to manage it. In some case, we should input part of data directory into the program.

So, our proposal is to develop single program with user friendly firmware for Bayesian Surplus Production model.

 

Considering the fact the SS or MULTIFAN is still in the introduction phase in ICCAT, Production model is still important as opponent model as at this stage, going with single model results is too dangerous. We need to verify the results of complex model through the comparison with the one by simpler model.

 

Considering the situation of not enough biological information, decrease of the time-area coverage of data of each fleet, sex specific characters of billfish and sharks, Bayesian type of treatment of some input priors should be quite beneficial. Also current Bayesian production model can treat multiple indices in the stochastic way with their CV.  

 

Best,
